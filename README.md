1. Starts with an opening animation following with a wekcome message.  
2. I have only optimised this app to view in mobile.
3. Lets the user choose user personas that relates to the them the most. This follows by asking the user about their mood (Happy, Sad, Stressed, and Depressed).  
4. Unique Dashboards used for each user persona and different to-do list, user activites for different moods of the user.
5. The different activities are interfaces of Sleep, meditation, Hydration tracker, timer, and Music player. Things like praising the user for doing these things and notifying them are also included.
6. Loading screens are included in each important section of the app, each with different colors and loading screen time.
7. In case we already know the user persona selected, Ctrl+Me is also there for only a specified persona in different pages.
8. Flowchart explaining the flow of the app is also there as a seperate page.
9. Wireframes of 4 different frames are in a seperate page.
10. I've used a lot of components because of its reusability and reducing load on the software. All the Components are made by me and they are included in a seperate page.
